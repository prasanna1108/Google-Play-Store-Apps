# Problem Statement:
The primary objective of this analysis is to predict whether an app is likely to achieve a high number of installs based on its attributes. Additionally, the project seeks to explore the underlying trends in the app market, such as category-wise performance, pricing strategies, rating patterns, and user preferences. This will help app developers, marketers, and stakeholders make informed decisions regarding app design, monetization, and user targeting. The challenge lies in handling data imbalances and extracting meaningful patterns that can effectively differentiate high-performing apps from the rest.
